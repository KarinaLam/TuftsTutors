TuftsTutors provides high-quality tutoring services that will ensure that they get the support they need to succeed in life. Available all weekdays and in both virtual and physical formats (1-to-1 or 1-to-class of 15 sessions), that means that your child can pick the tutoring format that fits them!</li> <br> <br>
      <li> We are proud to announce that TuftsTutors has gone virtual! No more hour-long rides to the tutoring centre, your child can now experience all that TuftsTutors has to offer with the click of a button. Your child can now bring their questions directly to a tutor and have them answered. If they're struggling in classes, we'll be glad to break down their questions into easily digestible literary concepts first, before considering how they make sense in the context of the question. Then, we move on to solve the question. </li> <br> <br>
      <li> TuftsTutors offers a great student experience by making sure group sizes are small. Tutors are only assigned to a maximum of 15 students each to ensure the quality of their sessions.
