      For Parents
     <ol>
       <li> Is your child's math grades something your concerned about? Don't worry, Tufts  Tutors is
         here to help! Math is a subject that many students have difficulty with, your child isn't
         the only one! We will help our students with their homework and any questions that they
         bring in for us. Even if there are no questions, we will help students with their math studies
         and other topics that they'd like to practice. </li> <br> <br>
       <li> Wonder what a session with Tufts Tutors is like? Generally, we would have the students
         bring in any homework problems they're struggling with at school. We would then cover
         the essential topics needed to understand the problem before attempting to solve the
         question. Once we see that the student has a solid understanding of the concepts, we
         would begin tackling the math problem. This gives the students a chance to think
         about what they know and do not know first. Afterwards, they will work on reviewing
         and mastering key concepts, which would eventually lead them to the solutions. </li> <br> <br>
