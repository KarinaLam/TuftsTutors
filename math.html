       <li> Is your child's math grades something your concerned about? Don't worry, TuftsTutors is <br>
         here to help! Math is a subject that many students have difficulty with, your child isn't<br>
         the only one! We will help our students with their homework and any questions that they<br>
         bring in for us. Even if there are no questions, we will help students with their math studies<br>
         and other topics that they'd like to practice. </li> <br> <br>
       <li> Wonder what a session with TuftsTutors is like? Generally, we would have the students<br>
         bring in any homework problems they're struggling with at school. We would then cover<br>
         the essential topics needed to understand the problem before attempting to solve the<br>
         question. Once we see that the student has a solid understanding of the concepts, we<br>
         would then begin to tackle the math problem. This gives the students a chance to think<br>
         about what they know and do not know first. Afterwards, they will work on reviewing<br>
         and mastering key concepts, which would eventually lead them to the solutions. </li> <br> <br>
